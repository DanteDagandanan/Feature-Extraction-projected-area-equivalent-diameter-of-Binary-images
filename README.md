# Feature-Extraction-projected-area-equivalent-diameter-of-Binary-images


This is a Python script that extracts features from binary images and saves them to a CSV file. The script reads in a list of image files, applies some image processing steps to remove the background and fill in holes, and then uses the skimage.measure.regionprops() function to extract various properties of the image regions (e.g. area, perimeter, eccentricity, etc.). The script then writes these properties to a CSV file, along with the name of the input image file. Here are some comments on the different parts of the script:

The script begins by importing various modules, including OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-image, glob, pandas, and natsort. These modules are used for image processing, file input/output, and data analysis.

The script then defines a list of property names (propList) that will be extracted for each image region. This list includes various geometric and morphological properties of the regions.

The script defines an output file (output_file) that will be used to save the extracted features to a CSV file. The script opens the file in "append" mode (i.e. any new data will be added to the end of the file).

The script then defines a loop that iterates through each file in a list of input image files (imageList). For each file, the script reads in the image using cv.imread(), converts it to grayscale using cv.cvtColor(), and applies an automatic threshold using cv.threshold() with the "OTSU" method. The script then uses cv.floodFill() to fill in any holes in the thresholded image, and combines the filled image with the original thresholded image using cv.bitwise_or(). The resulting image is added to a list of "filled" images (list_fillholl).

The script then uses skimage.measure.regionprops() to extract the properties of the regions in the filled image. For each region, the script writes the properties to the output file, along with the name of the input image file.

The script closes the output file.

Overall, this script provides a basic framework for extracting features from binary images using Python. However, there are a few areas where it could be improved or made more flexible:

The script assumes that all input images are in the same directory and have the same file extension. It might be useful to add some error checking or user input prompts to handle different directory structures or file formats.

The script only extracts a fixed set of properties for each image region. It might be useful to allow the user to specify which properties they want to extract, or to add some additional properties (e.g. texture features).

The script does not currently handle errors or exceptions very well. It might be useful to add some error checking or exception handling to make the script more robust.
